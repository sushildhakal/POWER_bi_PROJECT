PROJECT creating a dashboard using NSW crash Data Visualisation
# NSW Road Crash Data Analysis using Power BI
This project uses Power BI to analyze road crash data from the NSW government's open data portal. The data includes information about the location, time, and severity of crashes that occurred in NSW from 2014 to 2019.

# Data Source
The data used in this project was downloaded from the NSW government's open data portal at the following link: https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-crash-data/resource/f3fc2ed9-776c-430b-84cc-2495cce8cb1d

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze the road crash data and identify patterns and trends that can help inform road safety policies and interventions. The analysis includes visualizations of the following:

Number of crashes by year
Number of crashes by month
Number of crashes by day of the week
LGAs with the most crashes
Distribution of crash severity by year
Distribution of crash severity by road user type
Power BI Visualizations
The project uses various Power BI visualizations to present the analysis in an interactive and engaging way. These visualizations include:

Line charts
Maps

# Getting Started
To open the Power BI report, download the project files and open the Crash Data project.pbix file in Power BI Desktop. The report includes the data model and all the visualizations used in the analysis.
